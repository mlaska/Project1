Project Question:
 Is the Minneapolis Scooter Pilot Program successfully serving low income populations as defined by their goals?
 
 Goals: 
 in this project we will be reviewing Scooter placement and movement over time in the city of Minneapolis. 
 We would like to provide data correlating scooter use to low income areas via heat mapping
 
 In Scope 
  Utilizing data/API from Minneapolis.gov providing detailed scooter tracking informaion
    Utlizing datapoints provided May, 2019 through Aug, 2019
  Utilizing data/API from US Census.org (2017 Census data) to provie information on population and Low income areas
    Correlating low income by Zip Code
  
  Out of Scope
    Differentiating Scooters by Brand
    Calculations adjusting 2017 census data to reflect 2019 incomes
    
  Dependencies
    Ensuring data from Scooter database can be matched to Us Census data by Zip Code
  
  Level of Effort
    Creation of a Funtion to perform the following
      Merge each month of scooter data into one DataFrame
      Loop through each Location ID using the Minneapolis.gov API to identify the zipcode of each location
    Creation of a Function to perform the following
      Loop through US Census.gov API to pull all income data for Zip codes associated with the Minneapolis area
      Create a DataFrame of this data
    Creation of a fuction to perform the following
      Combine DataFrames from both above functions on start zipcode into a DataFrame with scooter and income data
      Create Plots 
        visualizing Low income areas over time by scooter start Date
        Visualizing income heat map of Minneapolis by zipcode
        Visualizing Scooter Catchment data
        Visualizing Trends of scooter Low income start vs High income start over time
        Month by Month plotting of Scooter placement (comparing how scooter movement is changing over time) 
        
   Risks
    not enough data to provide insight to the overall success of the program
    issues with API documentation muddling ability to create api to pull data
      Mitigation: download file of data from site provided and create function to analyze CSV file instead

   Parking Lot
     Make a heatmap to show the movement of scooters over time
